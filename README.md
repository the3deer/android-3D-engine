Android 3D Engine
=================

This is a 3D OpenGL ES 2.0/3.0 engine

As this is my first android library and my first 3D engine and I'm still learning the OpenGL 2.0 language, it is highly probable that there are bugs;
however, I will try to continue improving the library and adding more features. 
So please send me your comments, suggestions or complains by opening an [issue](https://github.com/the3deer/android-3D-engine/issues).

Usage
=====

- Create your own Android application (eg. using Android Studio )
- Execute the following command to include this module/library

    $ cd your-3d-git-project
    $ git submodule add https://github.com/the3deer/android-3D-engine.git engine

- Add engine in settings.gradle

    include ':app'
    include ':engine'

- Add dependency in your app/build.gradle

    implementation project(':engine')


Dependants
==========
